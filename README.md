1) sheevpalpatine.java tests to see if a string is a palindrome. In this case it tests "reliefpfpfeiller". A palindrome is something that is the same whether its being read from the left or right. When this program is run it comes back false because "reliefpfpfeiller" is not a palindrome. A quick example of a palindrom is "lol". It doesn't matter if its read from the left or right, its the same thing.

2) Binary Search Example Program

3) Selection Sort is faster.

Key Differences Between Bubble Sort and Selection Sort

- In the bubble sort, each element and its adjacent element is compared and swapped if required. On the other hand, selection sort works by selecting the element and swapping that particular element with the last element. The selected element could be largest or smallest depending on the order i.e., ascending or descending.

- The worst case complexity is same in both the algorithms, i.e., O(n2), but best complexity is different. Bubble sort takes an order of n time whereas selection sort consumes an order of n2 time.

- Bubble sort is a stable algorithm, in contrast, selection sort is unstable.

- Selection sort algorithm is fast and efficient as compared to bubble sort which is very slow and inefficient.

- Bubble sort algorithm is considered to be the most simple and inefficient algorithm, but selection sort algorithm is efficient as compared to bubble sort. Bubble sort also consumes additional space for storing temporary variable and needs more swaps.
